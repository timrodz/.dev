        ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ in 1995, Iâ€™m somewhat of a cross between millenials and Gen Zâ€™ers.
        That just means I understand some of todayâ€™s memes. Since I was young,
        computers have been a part of my life, so naturally Iâ€™m very happy I
        work with them on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe tools are just that: tools. For that reason, I donâ€™t
        have strong opinions about this or that technology; everything has a
        purpose, even if that means the code I wrote years ago doesnâ€™t look
        great today. That being said,{" "}
        <span className="font-semibold">
          these are the tools I enjoy working with the most (as of {date})

        When Iâ€™m not writing code, you can find me working out (gym/cycling),
        playing games (Age Of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5, Magic: The
        Gathering), planning the next travel destination, or thinking about what
        to learn next. By the way, hereâ€™s what I look like:
