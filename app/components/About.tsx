      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        {`Born in ChitrÃ©, PanamÃ¡ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ in 1995, I'm somewhat of a cross between
        millennials and Gen Z'ers. That means I understand some of today's
        memes. Since I was young, computers have been a part of my life, and I'm
        grateful I work with them dailyâ€”A dream scenario!`}

      <p>
        {`Software engineering aside, you can find me outdoors, working out
        (gym/cycling), playing games (Age Of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5, Magic:
        The Gathering), planning the next travel destination, or thinking about
        what to learn next. I'm currently learning Portuguese, music theory, and
        content creation.`}

        {`When it comes to tools and technologies, I believe they're there to help
        you solve problems, nothing else. I also don't have strong opinions
        about developer decisions when choosing a tech stack. Everything has a
        purpose; if it helps you solve a problem, that's what matters.`}
