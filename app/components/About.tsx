      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        Born in ChitrÃ©, PanamÃ¡ ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¦ in 1995, Iâ€™m somewhat of a cross between
        millennials and Gen Zâ€™ers. That means I understand some of todayâ€™s
        memes. Since I was young, computers have been a part of my life, and Iâ€™m
        grateful I work with them dailyâ€”A dream scenario!
      </p>
      <p>
        Software engineering aside, you can find me outdoors, working out
        (gym/cycling), playing games (Age Of Empires IV, Forza Horizon 5, Magic:
        The Gathering), planning the next travel destination, or thinking about
        what to learn next. Iâ€™m currently learning Portuguese, music theory, and
        content creation.
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to tools and technologies, I believe theyâ€™re there to help
        you solve problems, nothing else. I also donâ€™t have strong opinions
        about developer decisions when choosing a tech stack. Everything has a
        purpose; if it helps you solve a problem, thatâ€™s what matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, these are my favorite tools & technologies (as of {date}
        ):

      <TechStack
        technologies={[
          "React",
          "TypeScript",

          "Elixir",
          "PostgreSQL",
          "AWS",
        ]}
